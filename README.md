# VoiceControl
Send events (key, mouse) to an application using voice.

Analyses the microphone signals and determines the recorded note via a Fast Fourier Transformation. The user can specifiy via an user interface the event (keyboard or mouse event) that will be send to an application when a specified note
is detected. Using this application you can control, for example, games (car racing or something) with a musical instrument. Used by the author to get children interested in brass instruments.
